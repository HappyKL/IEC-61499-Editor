# IEC-61499-Editor
A WEB-based drag-and-drop PLC programming platform (according to  IEC 61499 international standard)

# Introduction
  The international standard IEC 61131-3 regulates the PLC programming language. The international standard IEC 61499 specification defines a general model of a distributed control system. At the same time, a large number of PLC programming platforms have also developed. 
  However, a web-based, cross-platform PLC programming platform based on IEC 61499 standard has never met. In this project, it has designed and implemented a WEB-based drag-and-drop PLC programming platform (according to IEC 61499 international standard). The platform provides users with an intuitive, convenient, efficient, and fast programming environment, allowing users to complete PLC programming based on the IEC 61499 standard without having to download applications locally, and also implements cross-platform.
